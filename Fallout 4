America in the year 2077 is a land of advanced technological achievements...
and terrible civil strife. As in any age, most ordinary people want only one
thing - a happy, peaceful life.
%
On the morning of Saturday, October 23, 2077 America was consumed by the flames
of nuclear war. The war with China had finally reached its cataclysmic
conclusion.
%
Even without any pieces, a power armor frame provides a variety of advantages,
like increased carry weight, greater melee damage and the elimination of
falling damage.
%
You can mix and match all different kinds of Power Armor pieces on a single
frame, and add mods to most of those pieces to increase their effectiveness.
%
Power Armor can be enhanced with a variety of mods that add specialized
functionality, like a jet boost, Tesla damage field, explosive impact landing,
integrated Stealth Boy, and auto Stimpaks.
%
Across the Commonwealth, some of the fiercest Raider leaders have scavenged old
suits of Power Armor and restored them to full working order.
%
The T-45 series was the first version of Power Armor ever employed on the
battlefield by the U.S. military. Many suits remain active in the Wasteland
today, and provide their wearers with substantial protection.
%
The T-51 series of Power Armor was the pinnacle of mechanized protection before
the Great War. First introduced in the Battle of Anchorage, it is highly valued
today for its increased protective capabilities.
%
The T-60 series of Power Armor saw extensive use by the United States Army
after the Battle of Anchorage. In fact, soldiers in T-60 Power Armor were among
those trying to retain order on October 23, 2077 - the day America fell to
atomic war...
%
The X-01 series of Power Armor was specially engineered and employed by
remnants of the U.S. military after the Great War, and offers increased
protection over the older, pre-war models.
%
The Vault Suit and a few other pieces of clothing, like long johns and Raider
Leathers, are thin enough to be worn underneath additional pieces of armor.
%
Leather Armor offers additional protection against energy damage.
%
Metal Armor offers additional protection against ballistic damage.
%
Combat Armor offers balanced protection against both energy and ballistic
damage.
%
Buffout is a powerful steroid that gained popularity with athletes before the
Great War. It grants temporary bonuses to Strength, Endurance and maximum
Health.
%
Using Jet creates an altered state of consciousness where time appears to slow,
allowing you to perform more actions than normal for a limited period of time.
%
Originally developed by the United States military to increase soldiers' combat
effectiveness, Psycho grants the user increased Damage output and Damage
Resistance for a limited period of time.
%
Need to get smart, quick? Mentats will boost both your Perception and
Intelligence for a limited period of time.
%
Rad-X significantly increases your Radiation Resistance for a limited period of
time. RadAway completely removes any radiation you've already been exposed to.
%
For fast, effective healing of both overall health and every injured body part,
nothing beats a Stimpak.
%
Using chems or alcohol can provide powerful temporary boosts, but can also lead
to addiction. When addicted, you have to consistently take the chem or alcohol
- failing to do so will inflict a severe stat penalty.
%
Popular with beatniks and intellectuals before the Great War, Daddy-O raises
Intelligence and Perception, but lowers Charisma, for a limited period of time.
%
A pre-war chem favored by those looking for a "happy escape," Daytripper raises
both Charisma and Luck, but lowers Strength, for a limited period of time.
%
Created before the war as a general performance enhancer, X-Cell never got out
of the prototype stage, but was widely distributed on the black market. It
boosts every SPECIAL attribute for a limited period of time, but is highly
addictive
%
Med-X is a powerful pain killer that effectively increases Damage Resistance
for a limited period of time.
%
As rare as it is powerful, Addictol completely cures its user of all
addictions.
%
To cure addiction, visit a doctor in any major settlement.
%
Diamond City was constructed in the remains of Boston's world-renowned baseball
stadium.
%
Diamond City, the "Great Green Jewel" of the Commonwealth, is the area's
largest and most secure settlement.
%
Diamond City's non-denominational All Faiths Chapel offers services and
counseling for all of Diamond City's residents, regardless of religion.
%
In the year 2229, a mysterious visitor to Diamond City killed several people.
It was only after he was shot dead by city security that the stranger was
revealed to be a synth. The people of the Commonwealth have feared The
Institute ever since.
%
Diamond City's newspaper, Publick Occurrences, gets its name from the first
newspaper ever published in Boston, in 1690.
%
Diamond City Radio broadcasts the most popular music from before the war, as
well as more recent news stories.
%
The Science Center has been instrumental in helping maintain Diamond City's
power, robotics and agriculture.
%
At the Mega Surgery Center Diamond City residents can undergo facial
reconstruction, if they tire of the same old look.
%
The Colonial Taphouse is Diamond City's upscale tavern, where the settlement's
more wealthy residents drink, socialize, and generally look down on everyone
else.
%
The Diamond City Schoolhouse offers a free education to all of the settlement's
children, regardless of family or social status.
%
Valentine's Detective Agency is run by private investigator Nick Valentine, who
has helped many of the residents of Diamond City over the years.
%
Bobbi No-Nose is a small-time operator with big-time plans. Every place she
sets up shop inevitably turns into a base of operations.
%
Now little more than a flophouse, Goodneighbor's Hotel Rexford was once the
center of a thriving chem trade.
%
The Old State House, once one of Boston's most renowned historic buildings, now
serves as the headquarters of Goodneighbor's mayor, Hancock. According to
popular legend, the leader took his name when he took the famous statesman's
outfit, once on display.
%
While chems are plentiful in Goodneighbor, there are those who claim the Memory
Den offers the best high possible - the experience of reliving the past...
%
Built in the remnants of an old subway station, the Third Rail offers live
jazz, stiff drinks, and a good chance to meet bad people.
%
Goodneighbor was built in and around the remains of Boston's old red light
district, Scollay Square.
%
Goodneighbor was founded in the year 2240, by a group of criminals who were
banished from Diamond City.
%
Goodneighbor's residents come from every walk of life, and the settlement
welcomes anyone strong enough to remain free, from robots and Ghouls to
criminals and chem addicts.
%
In Goodneighbor, taking the law into your own hands isn't only allowed, it's
expected. The settlement has one overriding rule - respect others, or face the
consequences.
%
If there's one place in the entire Commonwealth where people don't fear the
Institute, it's Goodneighbor. They love the freedom their community provides,
and would do anything necessary to defend it.
%
Want to prevent an enemy from fleeing? Cripple the legs.
%
You can run faster with your weapon holstered, and fastest when sprinting.
%
Heavier weapons typically deal more damage, but take up more weight in your
inventory, and slow you down when they're equipped.
%
Zooming in with a ranged weapon slows you down, but improves your accuracy.
%
Crouching will both improve your accuracy, and activate sneak mode.
%
If you start a fight you can't finish, try putting away your weapon. There's a
slight chance your opponent just might forgive you...
%
Melee attacks on enemies can stagger them, interrupting their attacks.
%
Actively blocking against a melee attacker might cause them to recoil, and
render their attack useless.
%
Weapons and creatures can deliver four different types of damage: Ballistic,
Energy, Radiation and Poison. Some enemies are naturally resistant against
certain forms of damage, but specialized armor can also offer the same
protection.
%
Actively blocking against a melee attacker might cause them to recoil, and deal
no damage.
%
Use the bash button to deliver a melee attack with any ranged weapon.
%
Some weapons can completely disintegrate or "gooify" an enemy upon death. Don't
worry - you can still retrieve any loot from their pile of ashes. Or... puddle.
%
To throw a grenade or Molotov cocktail, first equip it, and then hold the
Bash/Power Attack button.
%
When you set off a hostile mine, it will begin beeping a rapid countdown before
exploding. If you're quick enough, you can activate the mine within that time
to disarm it.
%
Successful attacks in V.A.T.S. build your Critical meter. Once the meter is
filled, you can unleash a devastating attack.
%
You can alter the weapons and attire of most companions by accessing the trade
menu in dialogue.
%
If you'd like to adventure alone, or with someone else, you can dismiss your
current companion by speaking with them.
%
Each companion has their own likes and dislikes. Some actions will earn their
respect. Others, their disappointment.
%
Sleeping in a bed when your romantic companion is nearby will grant the Lover's
Embrace perk, which grants a significant boost to any earned XP for a limited
time.
%
One of the Wasteland's most disgusting creatures, the Bloatfly shoots its
maggots as projectiles, and often explodes upon death.
%
Not only do Bloodbugs suck the blood of their victims, but they will often
shoot it back at them, causing distorted vision.
%
No creature represents the danger of the Wasteland as much as the Deathclaw,
which uses razor-sharp claws to rip apart its prey... in seconds.
%
The Wasteland is home to a variety of dogs, from vicious wild curs to trained
attack hounds.
%
While they can easily be mistaken for zombies, Feral Ghouls are actually
horribly irradiated humans whose brains have rotted away, causing madness.
%
Some creatures, like the Mirelurk King, Chameleon Deathclaw and Sentry Bot, can
utilize Stealth to turn themselves almost invisible and ambush unwary prey.
%
Most Mirelurks are heavily armored and resistant to most forms of damage, but
their faces are vulnerable.
%
Mole Rats often travel underground and then burst through the surface to ambush
their prey.
%
Super Mutants are often accompanied by Mutant Hounds, monstrous dogs that are
just as dangerous as their masters.
%
Radiation has mutated the common Emperor Scorpion into the deadly Radscorpion,
one of the Wasteland's fiercest predators. Beware its claws and poisoned
stinger.
%
The hideously mutated, two-headed Radstag is a pathetic creature that will
likely run at the first sign of contact. But if forced to fight, it can prove a
deadly opponent.
%
The fiercest flying insect in the Commonwealth, the Stingwing strikes
relentlessly with its poisoned stinger.
%
Super Mutants are stronger and more resilient than humans, and consider
themselves the Commonwealth's superior race.
%
Originally named by the descendants of those held in Chinese internment camps
before the Great War, the Yao Guai is a ferocious mutated bear.
%
The Assaultron robot was constructed by RobCo and sold to the U.S. military as
a frontline wartime combatant. It is fast and deadly at close range, and
employs a devastating laser at a distance. Some units can even employ stealth
technology.
%
Created by General Atomics International as a domestic servant robot, Mister
Handy is equipped with tools that can be used as weapons, if the need arises.
%
The Miss Nanny robot was created by General Atomics International as the female
equivalent of the Mister Handy. As such, it carries similar built-in armaments.
%
The Mister Gutsy was created by General Atomics International as a combat
alternative to its domestic Mister Handy robot.
%
The RobCo Protectron was constructed for a multitude of civil service
applications, from security to firefighting.
%
The firefighter model of Protectron is equipped with an internal cryo gun it
can utilize in any combat situation.
%
The medic model of Protectron was designed to use its hands as a defibrillator.
In combat, it utilizes this ability as a painful shock attack.
%
The construction model of Protectron was built to take damage. Some versions
also come equipped with an internal nail gun, which they can utilize in combat.
%
In combat, the police model of Protectron relies on strong melee attacks and a
painful electric shock.
%
Robots tend to get more dangerous as they get more damaged. When both their
arms are disabled, most robots will then charge at an opponent while initiating
a self-destruct sequence, and explode in a fiery final attack.
%
The Sentry Bot is one of the most dangerous robots ever created, and utilizes a
variety of heavy weapons systems to destroy its enemies. Upon death, it erupts
in a devastating explosion.
%
Because of its size, the Sentry Bot generates a significant amount of heat.
During combat, it will occasionally enter a "cooldown" state. When this
happens, the Sentry Bot's back panel will open, exposing its Fusion Core... and
presenting the best moment to strike.
%
Institute synths come in a variety of models, from the skeletal Gen 1 to the
advanced Gen 3, which is indistinguishable from a human.
%
Automated Turrets will track and attack their targets relentlessly, but can
often be reprogrammed from a nearby computer terminal.
%
The Gunners are the Commonwealth's most well organized mercenary group.
Unscrupulous and highly skilled, they will take any contract... if the price is
right.
%
Raiders are the scourge of the Wasteland, in the Commonwealth and everywhere
else. Loosely organized, with a power hierarchy based on pure ruthlessness,
they will attack anyone at any time... for any reason.
%
The Commonwealth lacks any sort of institutional justice system. Criminal
wrongdoing is dealt with harshly, and usually ends when the perpetrator or
victim lies dead.
%
When you steal an item, the owner will generally attempt to take it back from
you. If they can't, they may attack.
%
Piloted by Lancer-Captain Kells, the Prydwen has traveled extensively along the
East Coast... but this is its first journey to the Commonwealth.
%
While the Prydwen does not have any actual weapons systems, it always carries
enough troops, Vertibirds and supplies to mount a major offensive.
%
The Brotherhood of Steel is dedicated to the advancement of humanity, and views
mutation as a scourge. Super Mutants, Ghouls and any other "abominations" have
been deemed impure, and must be eradicated.
%
To the Brotherhood of Steel, the Gen 3 synths, which are indistinguishable from
humans, are a perfect example of science run amok - a technology that cannot be
fully controlled by humans.
%
Liberty Prime was a failed pre-War military project. The Brotherhood of Steel
completed that project, and the giant robot is now the most powerful weapon in
their arsenal.
%
Most Brotherhood of Steel soldiers utilize the most effective, technologically
advanced equipment available, like laser weapons and Power Armor.
%
Anyone recruited into the Brotherhood of Steel starts at the rank of Initiate,
and is mentored by a higher-ranking sponsor.
%
Children born into the Brotherhood of Steel begin their training, and
indoctrination, as Squires.
%
The highest rank a Brotherhood of Steel soldier can achieve is Sentinel. New
Elders are very specifically - and very rarely - selected.
%
The Institute is actually an advanced subterranean metropolis, a technological
marvel unlike anything seen on the surface of the Commonwealth.
%
The Institute was officially founded in the year 2110 by a group a of former
Commonwealth Institute of Technology students who took refuge in the college's
underground level at the time of the Great War.
%
After developing the Molecular Relay, an advanced teleportation device, the
Institute sealed off access to the surface and began their campaign of
underground expansion.
%
The Institute often sends its synths to the surface to scavenge for usable
materials. The affect this has on the Commonwealth, or its people, is not a
priority...
%
Institute scientists rarely leave the safety and comfort of their underground
utopia. If there are experiments to be conducted on the surface, they are
generally carried out by synths.
%
The Institute is ruled by a Directorate, made up of the individual heads of
each division, and one specially-appointed Director.
%
The BioScience division produces the majority of the Institute's food, but also
carries out a number of other, sometimes secret, projects.
%
The Advanced Systems division is responsible for developing the original
Molecular Relay, nearly one hundred years ago.
%
The Synth Retention Bureau is tasked with the retrieval of "escaped" Gen 3
synths - malfunctioning units whose self-aware AI has convinced them that they
are, in fact, alive.
%
The Institute's experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus, or FEV, ended
when Doctor Virgil went rogue and fled into the Commonwealth.
%
The Institute is convinced that the surface of the Commonwealth is doomed, and
the true future of the human race lies underground.
%
The Institute allows humans to live in a clean, safe, comfortable environment,
free from the strife and environmental hazards that have rendered the surface
nearly uninhabitable.
%
Before the war, C.I.T. conducted experiments in its underground nuclear
reactor. Today, it has been repurposed, and once activated will provide the
Institute with nearly limitless power.
%
The Minutemen once made their headquarters in South Boston's Fort Independence,
also known as "the Castle." That ended when a giant creature rose from the sea
decades ago and laid it to waste.
%
The Minutemen were formed over a century ago by ordinary people who simply
wanted to defend their home, the Commonwealth, from any threat imaginable.
Sadly, the group has fallen into disarray in recent years.
%
Radio Freedom is the radio station of the Minutemen, and allows them to
broadcast alerts all across the Commonwealth from their headquarters in the
Castle.
%
Use the Flare Gun to summon help from any nearby Minutemen.
%
Use Artillery Smoke Grenades to call in artillery strikes from nearby Minutemen
batteries.
%
The Vertibird Signal Grenade can be used to call in a friendly vertibird for
transport.
%
Fort Independence was named in 1797, at a ceremony presided over by President
John Adams. Before then, it was known as Castle William, and then Fort Adams.
Before its destruction in 2240, the fortification served as an apt headquarters
for the Minutemen.
%
The Minutemen first rose to prominence in the year 2180, when they defended
Diamond City against a horde of Super Mutant attackers.
%
Like the Minutemen of the Revolutionary era, the modern day Minutemen are
dedicated to defending the people of Massachusetts, at a minute's notice.
%
The only group in the Commonwealth willing to actually fight the Institute is
the Railroad, an organization almost as secretive as the Institute itself.
%
No one knows just how powerful the Railroad is, or if they even possess the
means to defeat their sworn enemy - the Institute.
%
The Institute discovered the Railroad's previous headquarters, and nearly
destroyed the group in the process. If the current HQ were to be discovered, it
would prove disastrous.
%
Railroad agents communicate via "railsigns," secret symbols scrawled throughout
the Commonwealth that indicate dangers, allies and even the occasional cache of
goods.
%
The Railroad relies on safehouses to hide runaway synths and resupply agents in
the field.
%
What the Railroad lacks in numbers they make up for in subterfuge. They rely on
secrecy and intelligence gathering to tip the odds in their fight against the
Institute.
%
A "heavy" is a Railroad agent tasked with bringing the fight directly to the
Institute. Their training prepares them for the most difficult and dangerous
assignments available.
%
While the Railroad's primary enemy is the Institute, they are also dedicated to
battling the general hatred of synths that has spread throughout the
Commonwealth.
%
P.A.M., or the Predictive Analytical Machine, is a unique robot with advanced
artificial intelligence, originally built to predict and stop a nuclear war.
While she ultimately failed in that duty, P.A.M. has proven instrumental to the
Railroad's operations.
%
Once you discover a location, you can use your map to fast travel back to it.
Normally, you must be outside to do so, but there are exceptions.
%
To enter and exit the Institute, simply fast travel to and from using the map.
This ability is only available if you stay in the Institute's good graces...
%
You can restore Health by using a Stimpak, eating food, visiting a doctor,
drinking from a water source, or sleeping in a bed.
%
Sleeping in any bed will fully restore your Health and heal any crippled body
parts.
%
Drinking from a water source is always a tactical choice - you will usually
restore lost Health, but raise your radiation level.
%
Sleeping in a rented or owned bed will give you a "Well Rested" bonus that
boosts your earned XP for for a limited time.
%
Combat too hard or too easy? You can change the game's difficulty at any time.
%
Need a real challenge? Try Survival difficulty. Health restoration will be
severely reduced.
%
The higher the difficulty setting, the greater your chance of finding Legendary
items.
%
Use the Pip-Boy to tune into different radio stations. If you close the Pip-Boy
while the radio is on, it will continue playing until you go back into the
Pip-Boy and turn it off.
%
Use a Chemistry Station to create useful chems and medicines.
%
You can use a Cooking station to create recipes from the various ingredients
you find, like wild plants and meat from slain creatures.
%
Use a Weapons Workbench to make useful modifications to most of your weapons.
%
Use an Armor Workbench to modify your armor and increase its resistances.
%
Use a power armor station to repair and make modifications to your Power Armor.
%
Every time you level up, your Health increases and you get to choose a new
perk.
%
Pre-war military checkpoints, scattered throughout the Commonwealth, are a
great place to find Fusion Cores.
%
To talk to a person, activate them while standing up. To attempt a pickpocket,
activate them while in Sneak mode.
%
Doctors, located in most settlements, provide a variety of services. They can
heal all wounds (including crippled limbs), cure radiation damage and cure
addiction to chems and alcohol. Most of them also sell medical supplies.
%
Want to change your hairstyle? Visit a barber in one of the major settlements.
%
Tired of the same old look? A reconstructive surgeon can give you a whole new
face...
%
When you get a new quest, it will not become active unless you have no other
active quests. Check the Quests section in your Pip-Boy to see which quests are
active.
%
If you have too many quest targets, check the Quests section of your Pip-Boy to
see if you have more than one active quest. In the Miscellaneous category, you
can turn each objective on or off.
%
Most shops are open during daylight hours, and closed at night.
%
If a companion goes down in combat, use a Stimpak on them to bring them back
into the fight.
%
Need to pass some someIn-game spelling time in a hurry? Using any piece of
unowned furniture will allow you to "Wait" for up to 24 hours.
%
The Commonwealth is a dangerous place, but tends to get considerably more
dangerous the farther south you travel...
%
The meat obtained from many of the Wasteland's animals can be specially
prepared at Cooking Stations, and turned into food items that can heal
radiation damage and provide unique bonuses.
%
If there's a skull displayed next to an enemy's name, it means they're several
levels higher than you, and may be difficult to defeat in combat. In such
cases, running away and returning when you're stronger might be the wisest
course of action.
%
Grown attached to a weapon? Give it a custom name at any Weapons Workbench.
%
Is the struggle of this world merely a pleasant game for you? Do you long for a
more brutal take on a life lived post apocalypse? If you answered "Yes and
yes!", Survival difficulty is for you!
%
In Survival, Adrenaline provides a bonus to your damage output. The higher your
Adrenaline, the higher the damage bonus. Sleeping for any amount of time will
lower your Adrenaline, taking your damage bonus down with it.
%
In Survival, Antibiotics, which can be crafted at Chem Stations, purchased from
doctors or found in medical containers, instantly heal the various effects of
Illness.
%
In Survival, both you and your foes are deadlier than ever. Don't expect to
survive more than a few hits from most enemies.
%
In Survival, the type of bed you're sleeping in determines the length of time
you're able to stay asleep. A sleeping bag will save your game and may save
your life, but it'll never give you a full night's rest and the benefits that
come with it.
%
In Survival, large doses of Caffeine, such as that found in Nuka Cola Quantum,
gives you a short reprieve from your tiredness, possibly buying you time to
finish a fight or find a bed.
%
In Survival, both you and your companion's Carry Weight has been significantly
reduced. Exceeding your carry weight reduces your Endurance and Agility stats,
and periodically damages your legs and health. Think of your back!
%
In Survival, if your companion goes down during combat, you must heal them
before they can get back up. If you leave the area without healing them, they
will return home to recover.
%
In Survival, enemies no longer appear on your compass. Keep your eyes peeled,
and your weapon ready.
%
In Survival, Crippled limbs will no longer auto-heal after combat. You will
remain crippled until you are healed from a Stimpak or until you sleep it off.
%
In Survival, Fast Travel is disabled. If you wish to be somewhere, you'll have
to get there the old-fashioned way.
%
In Survival, Fatigue works like radiation, but affects your Action Points (AP)
rather than your Hit Points (HP). Fatigue mostly comes from being tired, but
both hunger and thirst also affect it. The more Fatigue you've built up, the
less AP you'll have for actions like sprinting and VATS.
%
In Survival, a food's bonus effects, such as increased carry weight from
Radstag steak, will only apply if eaten when you are not currently hungry. Make
sure to take care of the basics before eating for bonuses.
%
In Survival, eating uncooked meat, drinking unpurified water, taking damage
from disease-ridden foes and using harmful Chems all put your body at increased
risk for various ill effects. Be smart and keep Antibiotics handy.
%
In Survival, items that cleanse your body of Rads come with the cost of making
you tired and temporarily damaging your immunity, leaving you more vulnerable
to Illness than usual.
%
In Survival, Stimpaks and Ammo both have weight. Bullets and shells have a
small amount of weight, which varies by caliber. Heavier items such as fusion
cores, rockets, and mini-nukes can really drag you down.
%
In Survival, manual, quicksaving & most autosaves are disabled. To save your
game, you'll need to find a bed and sleep for at least an hour.
%
In Survival, an items value is often a good way to determine how much hunger or
thirst it might counter. Keep in mind, certain items may not give you the
results you expect. For example, Chems and Alcohol dehydrate, Caffeine makes
you hungry, etc.
%
In Survival, you'll find it difficult to survive without taking proper care of
yourself. Going for extended periods of time without food, water, or rest will
begin to adversely affect your health. Stay hydrated, fed, and rested to remain
combat-ready.
%
In Survival, going without food, water or rest will begin to adversely affect
your health, hurting your SPECIAL stats, adding to your Fatigue, lowering your
immunity, and eventually even dealing physical damage to you.
%
Exiting back to the Main Menu will create an Exitsave. Next time you play and
load the Exitsave, it will delete itself until the next time you exit back to
the Main Menu.
%
Sanctuary Hills represents the latest in planned communities, and is home to a
diverse range of families.
%
Vault 111, constructed by Vault-Tec, was built to serve the residents of
Sanctuary Hills and Concord in the event of an atomic war.
%
Those who reserved spots in Vault 111 had no idea they would be cryogenically
frozen. In fact, almost every Vault was actually a secret social experiment
conducted by Vault-Tec.
%
The old Cambridge Police Station has been occupied by the Brotherhood of Steel,
and now serves as an important listening post and resupply depot.
%
Before the war, Fort Strong was a U.S. Army base and proving ground for
experimental weapons, like the Fat Man nuclear catapult. It has since been
overrun by Super Mutants.
%
In the years before the war, ArcJet Systems was a successful military and
civilian aerospace contractor, specializing in communications and propulsion
systems.
%
Before the Great War, Mass Fusion was Boston's premiere utility, providing
power to all of Massachusetts.
%
While primarily a publishing house, Hubris Comics had begun to expand into
radio, television and toys. The Silver Shroud and Grognak the Barbarian were
two of its most popular properties.
%
The Concord Museum of Freedom was a popular tourist destination before the war,
and featured historical exhibits ranging from the American Revolution, all the
way up to the Battle of Anchorage.
%
Once the local office of Galaxy News Network, GNN Plaza is now the headquarters
of the Gunners, the Commonwealth's most organized and dangerous mercenary
group.
%
The Commonwealth is occasionally plagued by radiation storms that blow in from
the Glowing Sea, far to the southwest.
%
Originally "The Commonwealth of Massachusetts," the state became known only as
the "The Commonwealth" after the Great War of 2077.
%
Many people in the Commonwealth view the Institute as the "boogeyman," living
in the shadows, striking out anywhere, at any time.
%
For the people of the Commonwealth, the idea of someone they know being
replaced by an Institute synth is a very real threat.
%
According to local history, the Institute formed from the remains of C.I.T.,
the Commonwealth Institute of Technology. But the college itself has lain in
ruins for more than two centuries.
%
Long ago, when the Institute created their first synths, they attempted to work
peacefully with the people of the Commonwealth. Mutual mistrust ended that
relationship quickly.
%
In the year 2077, the world was destroyed by nuclear fire. Very few managed to
escape to the safety of the Vaults.
%
All across the United States, in the aftermath of the Great War, the bottle
caps of Nuka-Cola are the most commonly used currency.
%
Nuka-Cola, the most popular American soda before the war, manufactured so many
bottles that the drink can still be found and enjoyed now, more than 200 years
later.
%
V.A.T.S., or the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, is an advanced combat
technology whose developmental origins have been lost to time...
%
America in the year 2077 was a land of advanced technological achievements...
and terrible civil strife. As in any age, most ordinary people wanted only one
thing - a happy, peaceful life. What they got was complete nuclear
annihilation.
%

In what was perhaps one of Vault-Tec's greatest construction mishaps, the
entrance to Vault 88 became buried in rubble as soon as the bombs fell during
the Great War. It was only recently uncovered, thanks to the efforts of some
curious Raiders.

When America descended into nuclear devastation on October 23, 2077, Vault 88
was still under construction. Vault-Tec's failure to complete the project on
time led to countless lost lives.
%
Before the Great War, it had been widely publicized that Vault-Tec Industries
had won the government contract to provide underground fallout shelters to the

These flavors in particular were only distributed in the southwestern area of

and Nuka-Orange only a few short years after the corporation was founded. They
were an instant success.

market. Boasting 35% alcohol-by-volume, the unusual soft drink found its
success at many of the finer lounges and restaurants around the country.
%
Although the Nuka-Cola Corporation would never admit it, Nuka-Cola Wild was
released to directly compete with Sunset Sarsaparilla after attempts to acquire

%
Nuka-Cola's award-winning taste is derived from a secret combination of
seventeen fruit essences which are balanced to enhance, but not overwhelm, that
classic cola flavor.
%
In 2062, the Nuka-Girl Rocketsuit costume was released to retailers just in
time for Halloween. Its popularity was so overwhelming, the stores couldn't
keep up with the demand.

Nuka-Cola's signature rocket-shaped bottle replaced the traditional curved
bottle when a rival corporation successfully sued for patent infringement.
Fortunately, the public saw the new bottle as an improvement and Nuka-Cola's
sales increased.

flavors of Nuka-Cola.
%
Just before Nuka-Cola Quantum was released, the World of Refreshment's water
was tinted a glowing blue color to simulate the look of the beverage for
promotional purposes.
%
Since the process of manufacturing Nuka-Cola was a such a closely-guarded
secret, the Bottling Plant featured extremely heavy automated security to deter
would-be industrial spies and saboteurs.
%
Dry Rock Gulch was built as a celebration of Nuka-Cola Wild, the root-beer
flavored beverage. Visitors could take a step back in time and have an

Due to the overwhelming success of Nuka-World, more parks were immediately
planned. Dry Rock Gulch opened in 2058, followed by Safari Adventure in 2067.
On both occasions, the amount of visitors almost doubled overnight.
%
Bradberton, Massachusetts was a small town founded in 2060 to help house the
hundreds of staff members who wanted to shorten their commute to
Nuka-World.
%
John-Caleb Bradberton, the inventor of Nuka-Cola, was the driving force behind
the design of Nuka-World. In late 2077, he abruptly disappeared from the
spotlight and his whereabouts became unknown.
%
Thanks to a sponsorship by the U.S. Military, Nuka-World featured a formidable
security force and had access to all sorts of military-grade hardware.
%
Even though it was one of the oldest rides in Kiddie Kingdom, visitors often
rode the Ferris Wheel to relax and get a bird's eye view of the
brightly-decorated park.
%
With its clowns, candy-themed buildings and gentler rides, Kiddie Kingdom was
the ideal destination for Nuka-World's younger visitors and their parents.
%
The highlight of Kiddie Kingdom was Oswald the Outrageous's Magic Show held
within King Cola's Court. The show was spectacular, and often sold out for the
day within a few hours.
%
Nuka-Town U.S.A. boasted several unique service attractions such as The Parlor
Dinner Theater, Cappy's Cafe, the Nuka-Cade, the Fizztop Grille and the
Bradberton Amphitheater as well as the bruise-inducing Cola-Cars ride.

Rollers. Visitors would spend hours, and countless numbers of tokens, trying to
win tickets for a variety of prizes.

Safari Adventure was Nuka-World's attempt at opening a zoological park.
Although it was quite a popular attraction, the park was constantly under fire
in the media from radical animal-rights groups.
%
The Angry Anaconda Rollercoaster was the newest attraction at Safari Adventure.
Although close to opening, the bombs fell before the construction was able to
be completed.
%
In addition to its large outdoor habitats, Safari Adventure featured several
indoor attractions such as the Primate House, the Bear Cave and the
ever-popular Reptile House.
%
The Grandchester Mystery Mansion was an opportunistic tourist trap that was
built near Nuka-World purely to take advantage of the amount of traffic the
huge parks were generating.
%
The Disciples prefer the use of knives in combat, but will resort to firearms
when they're clearly outgunned.
%
In the past, the Disciples never left a victim alive. After the alliance of
gangs at Nuka-World, they've learned to curb their appetite for blood.
%
Skill. Discretion. Caps. The Raider gang known as the "Operators" hold all
three in highest regard.
%
Mags and William Black run the Operators from The Parlor, their sanctuary in
