Smoke and cinders constantly bellow up from the mines in the Ash Heap.
Survivors believed this was caused by fires in the tunnels below, raging
unceasingly for some unknown reason.
%
In the region survivors dubbed the "Ash Heap," a thick layer of filthy smoke
blankets the area, providing cover for friend and foe alike.
%
The mines deep within Appalachia's mountains still hold riches for those brave
enough to venture below...
%
Before the war, Mount Blair was a large-scale coal mining site where gigantic
digging machines removed entire portions of the mountaintop at once.
%
The Garrahans and Hornwrights were the two major families in charge of
Appalachia's mining industry. They owned lavish estates in the mountains
overlooking their precious mines.
%
The colorful red florae of the Cranberry Bog were originally West Virginia's
naturally occurring cranberry, pitcher, and sundew plants.
%
The survivors of Appalachia avoided the Cranberry Bog more than any other
region, and only the most well-equipped dared to travel here.
%
Allegheny Asylum was originally built in the mid-1800s as a treatment facility
for the mentally ill.
%
Watoga was built as a joint effort between the federal government, RobCo, and
Atomic Mining Services to build a "city of the future."
%
All public services in the city of Watoga were designed to be completely
automated, including a full staff of security robots.
%
The region surrounding Vault 76 was known as "the Forest" to the survivors of
Appalachia. Still rich in plant and animal life, it is an ideal place to
scrounge for food and water.
%
Although relatively untouched by the bombs, the Forest region of Appalachia is
still home to the mutated beasts that now roam the countryside. Survivors even
reported finding mutated plants with unusual properties...
%
While Morgantown was home to Vault-Tec University and experienced something of
a re-vitalization before the war, the townspeople all knew the harsh truth:
Vault entrance was not guaranteed.
%
Charleston was the capitol of West Virginia and one of the largest cities in
the area. Prior to the Great War, it was a hotbed of political dissent and saw
countless protests for workers' rights.
%
A small town near the Vault 76 construction site, Flatwoods was home to a local
motel, tavern, and church. Vault-Tec projections for the survivability of the
residents of this area were not optimistic.
%
Known as the "Mire" by survivors of Appalachia, this swampy region is home to
twisting vines, large tree canopies, and tall grass. All easy places for things
to hide...
%
Mutated plants known as "Strangler" vines infest the Mire. They seem to attach
to living things, notably the large trees in the area.
%
The Dyer Chemical plant originally produced animal feed and other phosphates
used for nearby farms.
%
Harpers Ferry was a small town that depended on tourism. This put them at odds
with the growing "Free States" movement, whose conspiracy theories put off
patriotic visitors.
%
Camp Venture was a survival skills training facility, open to tourists who
wanted to learn how to rough it out in the wilderness. Hopefully, those lessons
came in handy.
%
The region of Appalachia known to survivors as the "Savage Divide" is a
mountainous area whose rocky landscape is difficult to cross and easy to get
lost in.
%
Before the Great War, the mountains of Appalachia were home to ski resorts, bed
and breakfasts, and cabins available to rent by eager tourists.
%
The Top of the World was originally an enormous ski lift station, complete with
shops and restaurants at its peak.
%
Nestled in the mountains is a spiritual retreat center known as the Palace of
the Winding Path. Its unique architecture stands in stark contrast to the rest
of Appalachia.
%
Government facilities dot the landscape of Appalachia's mountains. Trading
rumors of the goings on inside those fenced-in walls was a popular pre-war
pastime.
%
The region known to survivors as the "Toxic Valley" is covered by industrial
white powder and polluted water sources.
%
The lake and other polluted waters of the Toxic Valley region are home to all
manner of mutated, aquatic beasts.
%
Grafton Steel Mill was the center of economic development for the town of
Grafton, and its large, industrial machines remain relatively intact.
%
The town of Grafton was built on the shores of the Tygart Valley River. It was
a hub for shipping prior to the Great War, thanks to having both water and
railroad access.
%
Built to provide power to the Steel Mill, the Grafton Dam is now filled with
the polluted waters of the Toxic Valley.
%
Built in 1858, The Whitespring was famous for its southern style and sulphur
springs.
%
The Whitespring Resort had a long history of business with the federal
government, and counted sitting US Presidents among its guests.
%
Under great financial strain before the war, The Whitespring was forced to sell
much of its surrounding land and replace the resort staff with more
cost-effective robots.

Objectives and quest targets with a star icon next to them are being shared by
your team leader. You are helping them complete this objective and will receive
bonus awards when they do.
%
Items with a double-diamond icon next to them are quest items for one of your
teammates. Your teammate must pick up this item themselves, so let them know
where it is!
%
Teammates helping you on a quest can fight enemies and locate quest items, but
they cannot pick up your quest items or activate terminal entries meant for
your quest.

Vault 76 was built to save the best and brightest in the event of a nuclear
holocaust. On Reclamation Day, they would emerge and begin to rebuild America.
Today is that day...
%
Before the Great War, Appalachian mining companies and other industrial
interests pursued automation to a near unprecedented degree, leading to
widespread job loss and civil unrest.
%
On October 23, 2077, in what came to be known as the "Great War", the world was
engulfed in nuclear fire. In the United States, a fortunate minority escaped to
the safety of great underground Vaults.
%
Durable, easy to carry, and quickly recognizable, the Nuka-Cola bottle cap is
one of the most common currencies used by traders in post-war America.
%
The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S., grants the user increased
combat precision and tactical awareness.
%
Despite being a land of incredible technological achievement, war and civil
strife came to define much of American life by 2077, when things finally
erupted into global nuclear Armageddon.
%
Vault 76 was built to house the best and brightest of America. Unlike most of
Vault-Tec's projects, it was exactly what it appeared: a refuge for the future
hope of humanity.
%
In 2031, Vault-Tec re-branded Morgantown's local college as Vault-Tec
University, and some of their top executives and scientists either taught or
graduated from there. Go Fighting Wendigos!
%
To survive in post-war Appalachia, it's important to make sure you're always
stocked with food and water. Thirst and hunger can kill you just as sure as any
Deathclaw.
%
Be careful taking too many chems. Not only do you risk addiction, but many
chems increase hunger and thirst.
%
You can craft remedies for diseases at a Cooking Station or Chemistry Station.
Without a remedy, a disease will run its course and go away after enough time
has passed.
%
Natural water sources are irradiated and carry disease. Drink directly from
rivers and streams at your peril. When in doubt, boil it out!
%
Raw meat and plant ingredients may satisfy hunger, but cooking them will
increase their effectiveness and removes the risk of disease.
%
Diseases spread by being attacked by creatures, eating raw food, swimming in or
drinking dirty water, or spending too much time in a hazardous environment.
%
Basic cooking recipes will unlock when you first pick up a new type of raw
food.
%
Wearing a Gas Mask or Hazmat Suit will eliminate the risk of Disease from
sources like smoke inhalation and being submerged in water.
%
Easily modified, reliable, and packing decent stopping power, the 10mm pistol
is one of the most trusted sidearms in the Wasteland for a reason.
%
The Alien Blaster is a powerful energy beam weapon that can completely
disintegrate enemies.
%
You might think that you'd never see someone walk the hills of Appalachia with
a portable naval cannon, but the existence of the Broadsider would prove you
wrong.
%
The tools of the past have now become the tools of the present. Chainsaws, fire
axes, and even rolling pins serve as the arms of many a Wasteland combatant.
%
A terrifyingly simple idea, the Deathclaw Gauntlet is built from the severed
arm of its namesake.
%
A hand-held catapult might not sound like an effective infantry weapon, but if
that catapult launches miniature nuclear bombs? Now you're talking.
%
The Flamer deals sustained energy damage in a wide area directly in front of
it.
%
The Gamma Gun deals Radiation damage, and as such is mainly effective against
human opponents.
%
The Minigun will spin up faster and faster as you pull the trigger. Once it
reaches maximum velocity, it will start firing.
%
A weaponized chainsaw the size of a large knife, the Ripper can tear into
opponents, causing devastating melee damage.
%
What's more deadly than being hit by a sledgehammer? Being hit by a
sledgehammer that has a rocket strapped to it. Behold the design philosophy of
the Super Sledge.
%
An exotic weapon, the Syringer is used to deliver a variety of ingenious and
cruel chems to an opponent.
%
Automatic weapons fire continuously as their trigger is pulled. They include
the Submachine Gun, and versions of the Assault Rifle and Combat Rifle.
%
Black Powder weapons were considered relics even before the Great War.
Extremely slow to reload, they can still be deadly in the hands of an expert.
%
Explosive weapons deal damage in a wide area of effect. They include grenades,
mines, the Fat Man, and the Missile Launcher.
%
Heavy Guns are generally large, bulky, and exceedingly powerful. They include
non-explosive energy and ballistic weapons such as the Flamer, Gatling Laser,
and Minigun.
%
Laser weapons, like the Laser Rifle and Laser Pistol, deal energy damage. They
can disintegrate foes, leaving behind piles of ash.

include the semi-automatic and bolt-action versions of the Assault Rifle,
Combat Rifle, and Hunting Rifle.
%
Pipe weapons, such as the Pipe Revolver and Pipe Rifle, are crude, low-tech and
highly modifiable.
%
Pistols are typically smaller than rifles and fire faster, but generally do
less damage. They include the 10mm, Pipe Pistol, and Black Powder Pistol.
%
Plasma weapons, like the Plasma Rifle and Plasma Pistol, deal energy damage.
They can melt enemies, leaving behind a pile of "goo."
%
Rifles are generally long, of average size, and require two hands to fire. They
include the Assault Rifle, Combat Rifle, Hunting Rifle, Laser Rifle, and
Submachine Gun.
%
Shotguns, like the pump-action and double-barreled, do more damage the closer
you are to the target.
%

survivors and invite them to share in the Vault's bounty.
%
Vault 94 included agricultural research facilities, an extensive seed bank, and
Vault-Tec's greatest innovation, a Garden of Eden Creation Kit.
%
Vault 96 was home to five brilliant scientists, thousands of cryogenically
preserved creatures, and an automated security force to keep them both under
control.
%
With its vast gene banks and cryogenic storage bays, Vault 96 was intended to
rebuild entire ecosystems in the aftermath of a nuclear war. Or so its
residents were told.
%
The Vault 96 Mainframe incorporated cutting-edge quantum vacuum tube arrays to
model, simulate, and conduct rapid genetic experiments.

%
The Blood Eagles revel in violence and bloodshed, and generally attack on
sight, with little regard for their own safety.
%
Thanks to their anarchic nature, would-be leaders among the Blood Eagles tend
to have very limited lifespans.
%
The Raiders who reside in the settlement of Crater may be selfish and violent,
but they can at least (occasionally) be reasoned with. The same can not be said
of the Blood Eagles...
%
The enigmatic and deadly mutant creatures known as Floaters store noxious gases
in their floatation bladders, which allow them to move through the air in
search of prey.
%
To the cultists who worship the Mothman, Appalachia is holy ground, and all
non-believers must be driven out... or destroyed.
%
The Cult of the Mothman is made up of fanatics who seek the blessings of the
enigmatic creature known as the Mothman, which they believe is a divine being.
%
The Mothman cultists seek to become one with the divine light, and they believe
the Mothman will guide the worthy to this sacred source of everlasting life.
%
As large as it is grotesque, the towering Wendigo Colossus has multiple heads,
each of which can attack its prey independently.
%
Some interiors in the game are private, meaning only you and your teammates can
enter. When you approach a private interior, you'll be given the option to
enter your own or your team leader's.
%
In most cases, quest progress in private interiors is only saved once all the
activity in the interior is completed. Make sure to wrap up all your current
goals before logging off!
%
Quest progress inside a private interior is personalized. You won't be able to
progress your own quest inside your team leader's space.

Curious what dialogue choices your teammate is making? Approach them and select
"Listen" to eavesdrop on their conversations.
%
Get on the bad side of the Raiders at Crater or the Settlers of Foundation?
Rumor has it someone at the Wayward might be able to help you out...
%
When the Diehards Raider gang returned to Appalachia, they settled in the area
of the crashed space station and named their new home the Crater.
%
Meg leads the Raiders at Crater with a cool head and pragmatic nature, but she
won't hesitate to employ violence if she or her people are threatened.
%
Many of the Raiders who dwell at Crater are opportunistic and power-hungry,
just waiting for a chance to improve their standing even if it means
eliminating a rival.
%
Amid the debris of the crashed space station, the Raiders found sophisticated
communications equipment they now use to monitor radio traffic in Appalachia.
%
The Raiders believe that strength is the key to survival, and they view the
Settlers of Foundation as weak and ripe for conquest.
%
A group of identical Protectrons named Sunny serve as vendors at Foundation.
Each competes with the others to establish itself as the real Sunny.
%
The Settlers at Foundation rely on cooperation and collaboration, but respect
the guidance of Paige and Ward, who are the closest the settlement has to
leaders.
%
Foundation was constructed on the site of the Spruce Knob campground, affording
the Settlers a commanding view of the nearby hills and valleys.
%
The Settlers at Foundation traveled from a variety of areas to make a new home
in Appalachia, but most come from various parts of Pennsylvania.
%
The settlement of Foundation represents the first step in the Settlers' plan to
reclaim Appalachia, through building, expansion and community.
%
The Mothman cultists have claimed the Kanawha County Cemetery as a place of
holy communion. By night, they perform rituals in the hopes of summoning their
deity.
%
As the ranks of the Mothman cult have grown, its members have settled in the
scenic town of Point Pleasant, claiming it as their new home.
%
RobCo, a leading corporation in the design and manufacture of robots (as well
as the Pip-Boy), maintained contracts with several other corporations and
governments... many of which involved unorthodox experiments.
%
Seeking a foothold in Appalachia, the savage Blood Eagles have established a
stronghold at the old Rollins Work Camp.
%
Located on the outskirts of Flatwoods, the Wayward is a bar and gathering place
serving the people who've returned to Appalachia to seek their fortunes.
%
A forgotten remnant of an Enclave project, whatever occurred here slipped into
obscurity thanks to the Enclave's post-war conflicts.
%
Formerly the ATLAS Observatory, Fort Atlas now serves as the headquarters of
the new Brotherhood of Steel in Appalachia.
%
The machinery beneath Fort Atlas is a legacy of the long-abandoned research
once conducted in this facility. Why it bears little resemblance to the
mechanisms of a telescope has remained a mystery.
%
This underground structure was originally intended to be someone's budget
version of a Vault. Its new life as a supply cache for the Brotherhood of Steel
is likely to attract unwanted attention.
%
The Orwells were in dire financial straits before the bombs fell. Ironically,
this expensive shelter failed to save them in the end.
%
Each Shelter has its own workshop budget. Items you build in one Shelter will
not count against your C.A.M.P. budget or your budget in other Shelters.
%
Unlike some other instanced interiors, Shelters are not private. Every player
on your server can enter your Shelter, whether they are on your team or not.
%
You can use the Shelters Control Panel near the entrance of any Shelter to
enter workshop mode. It can also be used to scrap or repair all items in that
Shelter.
%
Some workshop rules have been relaxed in Shelters. Items won't require support,
and can be placed floating!
%
The floors in your Shelter act as foundations. You can build directly on them
without building foundations of your own.
%
You can toggle workshop snapping on and off in Shelters at any time using the
workshop menu.
%
Not all C.A.M.P. items are buildable in Shelters. Some categories and
individual items are currently unavailable.
